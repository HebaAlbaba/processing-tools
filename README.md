Helper tools for Processing skectches.

These processing tools are meant to help [Processing](http://processing.org) based coders to get their work done quicker with a couple of simple utilities:

## Bootstrap:

The Bootstrap tool for Processing 2.0+ lets coders load a predefined template to their current Processing sketch as a base for further coding, removing the tedious process of writing base Procesing style code like setup(), draw() and more. Bootstrap is the successor of the old initSketch tool, which had the same functionality and has now been renamed.

Bootstrap goes along very well with this other tool:

## Templater

The Templater tool for Processing 2.0+ is the perfect companion for Bootstrap. It allows the coder to save the currently visible sketch as a template in the templates folder, which can then be used by Bootstrap to initialize sketches with different templates. Templater is the successor of the old saveTemplate tool, which had the same functionality and has now been renamed.
