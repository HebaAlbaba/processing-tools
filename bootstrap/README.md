# Bootstrap:

The Bootstrap tool for Processing 2.0+ lets coders load a predefined template to their current Processing sketch as a base for further coding, removing the tedious process of writing base Procesing style code like setup(), draw() and more. Bootstrap superceedes the old InitSketch tool, and build upon the original code with better coding style and encapsulation.

Bootstrap goes along very well with [Templater](http://poifox.com/templater)
