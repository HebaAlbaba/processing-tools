# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the tool's function. This will be
# shown from inside the PDE when the tool is being installed. Avoid repeating
# the name of your tool here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like

# end with a period.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
