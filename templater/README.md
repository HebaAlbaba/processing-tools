# [Templater](http://poifox.com/templater):

The Templater tool for Processing 2.0+ is the perfect companion for Bootstrap. It allows the coder to save the currently visible sketch as a template in the templates folder, which can then be used by Bootstrap to initialize sketches with different templates. Templater superceedes the old SaveTemplate tool, and builds upon the original code with better coding style and encapsulation.

Templater goes along very well with [Bootstrap](http://poifox.com/bootstrap)
